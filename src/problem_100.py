  Arranged probability
  Problem 100
  
  If a box contains twenty-one coloured discs, composed of fifteen blue discs 
  and six red discs, and two discs were taken at random, it can be seen that the
  probability of taking two blue discs, P(BB) = (15/21)Ã—(14/20) = 1/2.
  
  The next such arrangement, for which there is exactly 50% chance of taking two
  blue discs at random, is a box containing eighty-five blue discs and 
  thirty-five red discs.
  
  By finding the first arrangement to contain over 10^12 = 1,000,000,000,000 
  discs in total, determine the number of blue discs that the box would contain.
