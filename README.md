- What's Project Euler?

    Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just      mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of     a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

- What's in this repository?

    Here you can find my solutions to Problems in the Project Euler.
    They might not be the most efficient solution, but I make comments for what could be improved in the code where it's      possible after reading the solution pdf.
